            <h2>Heading out on your first voyage</h2>
            <p>At this point you have all the nescessary information to head out on your first voyage! There are plenty of topics including the physics behind sailing that I did not dive into but I have laid out the information needed to go on your first sail. I highly recommend though that if you do have the chance to go sailing with an instructor that you do that. </p>
            <p>One final tip that I have to go sailing is to realize that sailing is a lot about letting the wind and the waves guide the boat and then balance accordingly. It takes lots of practice but there is something so freeing to be in a sailboat that is solely controlled by forces outside of your control! Also know that the amazing part of sailboats is that while they can be easier to tip, they also have the amazing quality that they are extremly hard to sink. in fact if you do tip your sailboat you can flip it back up by pushing your weight down on the keel/daggerboard and it should flip back up relatively easily.</p>

            <h3> Note: For those curious about the physics </h3>
            <p>Understanding the physics behind sailing is not required to sail a sailboat, however it is interesting to know! </p>
            <p>The physics behind sailing can be described by Bernoulli's Principle. This principle is the idea that as a higher velocity is created on one side leading to lower pressure on the other side. This causes a pressure difference on either side, in this case on either side of the sail. Due to the pressure difference the system tries to get back to a state of equilibrium which in this case is the high pressure air trying to move towards the low pressure side of the sail. Once the sail is able to “capture” the wind it then is able to travel in the direction of the resultant force. The resultant force is the combination of all the forces acting on the sail.</p>
