            <h2>Heading out on your first voyage</h2>
            <p>At this point you have all the necessary information to head out on your first voyage! There are plenty of topics that I did not dive into but I have laid out the information needed to go on your first sail. I highly recommend though that if you do have the chance to go sailing with an instructor that you do. </p>
            <p>One final tip that I have to go sailing is to realize that sailing is a lot about letting the wind and the waves guide the boat and then balance accordingly. It takes lots of practice but there is something so freeing about being in a sailboat that is solely controlled by forces outside of your control! Also know that the amazing part of sailboats is that while they can be easier to tip, they also have the amazing quality that they are extremely hard to sink. In fact if you do tip your sailboat you can flip it back up by pushing your weight down on the keel/daggerboard and it should flip back up relatively easily. </p>
            <p> My hope is that you have learned a lot from this site and feel much more confident taking your sailboat out for a spin or at the very least learned some more about sailing that you didn't know before. I hope that you have many adventures and have tons of fun exploring new places! Safe travels on your journey!</p>
